<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Val, and I am a Web Developer. I started out my journey as Web Developer 3 weeks ago and I aim to become a professional in this position.
Many people find this skill very hard due to the lack of patience and/or time. Fortunately, I have both. I've tried my very best to understand every
single subject that goes on in Angela's course on Web developement, enhancing my knowledge further on every subject. So far, I've achieved an intermediate level at HTML,
which to be honest, was a lot easier than I even expected, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge further in Web Development. </p>
