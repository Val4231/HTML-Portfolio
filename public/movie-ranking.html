<h1>The Absolute Bangers of All Movies in My Opinion</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
  <h3>Insidious</h3>
   <p>Down-right terrifying movie, had me imagining a red-faced demon on my wall staring at me as I slept. (Watch at your own risk.)</p>
  <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
   <p>One of the most eye-opening anime movies. A long emotional rollercoaster and a good perspective from the main charcter which was once a bully.</p>
  <h3>The Nun</h3>
   <p>Another horror movie that messed with my active imagination for a while. Couldn't help, but avert my eyes from it during some scenes.</p>
